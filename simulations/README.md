simulation
==========

This attempts to model and simulate the dapploy v3 design, and answer the following:

 - how are load balancers selected and reselected
 - what does the protocol communication flow look like (ie. between different nodes, on-chain vs off-chain)
 - how do the following mechanisms work:
   - increased demand for edge bandwidth
   - seed ratio reporting verification and auditing
   - reward distribution of DPLY
